Graduated as an Electrical Engineer from FAST NUCES

Currently Working as a Software Design Engineer apt with C/C++, python, linux and bash. My expertise lies in fast packet processing, mainly using DPDK. I am bit of a fanatic about learning new stuff. I have taken part in designing, developing, optimizing and deploying an inline packet processing solutions. Other than that I always enjoyed activities like robotics, gaming, sketching/painting and reading about history.
